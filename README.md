# Word Jumble Game (C++)

A classic **Word Jumble** console game built entirely in **C++**. This project is designed as a learning exercise for beginners in C++ programming, focusing on core language features, basic game logic, and console interaction.

## Features

* **Jumbled Words**: Unscramble randomly jumbled words to test your vocabulary and quick thinking.
* **Hint System**: Get a helpful clue by revealing one letter at a time when you're stuck.
* **Console-Based**: A simple, text-based interface for straightforward gameplay.
* **Expandable Word List**: Designed to easily accommodate a large dictionary of words (currently uses a small sample for development).

## How to Play

1.  The game will present you with a jumbled word.
2.  Your goal is to type the correct, unscrambled word.
3.  Type `hint` to reveal one letter of the secret word.
4.  Type `quit` to exit the game at any time.

## Project Status

This is an ongoing project. So far, we have implemented the core game loop, word jumbling logic, and a functional hint system. Future plans include:

* Loading words from a file for a larger vocabulary (approx. 1000 words).
* Implementing difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
* Adding scoring and multiple rounds.
* *Potential future additions*: Basic sound effects (BGM and SFX) and a simple GUI (though this is a more advanced goal for a beginner project).

## Getting Started (for Developers)

To compile and run this game on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/word-jumble-cpp.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/word-jumble-cpp.git)
    cd word-jumble-cpp
    ```
    *(Replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username)*

2.  **Compile with g++ (or your preferred C++ compiler):**
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o word_jumble
    ```
    *(Assuming your main source file is named `main.cpp`)*

3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./word_jumble
    ```
    *(On Windows, you might type `word_jumble.exe`)*

## Learning Journey

This project serves as a practical application of C++ fundamentals for a beginner. It covers concepts such as:

* Standard Library containers (`std::string`, `std::vector`)
* Functions and modular programming
* Input/Output operations (`std::cin`, `std::cout`)
* Random number generation (`<random>`, `<ctime>`)
* String manipulation (`std::transform`, `std::shuffle`)
* Basic game loop design

### **Why this summary is effective:**

* **Clear Title**: Immediately identifies the project.
* **Concise Description**: Tells what the game is and its purpose (learning).
* **Features List**: Highlights the core functionalities in an easy-to-read format.
* **How to Play**: Provides quick instructions for users.
* **Project Status**: Gives an honest overview of where the project is, including future plans. This is great for an ongoing learning project.
* **Getting Started**: Essential for anyone wanting to download and run your code. Provides clear command-line instructions.
* **Learning Journey**: This is particularly good for your project as it emphasizes that you are a beginner and highlights the C++ concepts you are learning. This makes your repository valuable not just as a game, but as a learning resource and a showcase of your skills.
* **Markdown Formatting**: Uses headings, bold text, and code blocks for readability on GitHub.

Remember to create a file named `README.md` in the root directory of your GitHub repository and paste this content into it. You'll also want to make sure your primary C++ source file is named `main.cpp` as referenced in the instructions.
